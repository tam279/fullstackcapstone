/* The CSS code `.comments-container` is targeting an HTML element with the class name
"comments-container". It is setting the height of the element to 400 pixels and applying the
`overflow-y: auto;` property, which means that if the content inside the element exceeds the height,
a vertical scrollbar will appear to allow scrolling through the content. */
